To test it, just run:

sbt compile test

NOTE:

- given the time constraint, I didn't manage to implement all the test scenarios
- also, some improvement is missing (ie. error management when a player's position is updated)
- not sure whether my implementation of game status is actually needed but because of the time constraints, I had to leave it there.
